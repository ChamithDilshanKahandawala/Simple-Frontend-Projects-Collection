# Simple-Frontend-Projects-Collection
This repository contains a collection of small projects I am building using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this repo is to improve my technical knowledge and practice frontend development skills. Each project focuses on basic concepts like layouts, styling, interactivity, and DOM manipulation.
